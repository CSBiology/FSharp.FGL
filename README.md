# FSharp.FGL

FSharp.FGL is intended to be a user friendly functional graph-library written in F#.

The library is based on Martin Erwigs [Inductive Graph Model](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/InductiveGraphs_JFP01.pdf). The implementation itself is based on the [Hekate graph library](https://github.com/xyncro/hekate). The aim of the FSharp.FGL library is to offer a more thorough set of graph related functions, so users focus on usage rather than implementation.	

The documentation for FSharp.FGL can be found [here](https://csbiology.github.io/FSharp.FGL).
